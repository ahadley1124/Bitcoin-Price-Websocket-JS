# Bitcoin-Price-Websocket-JS

## What is this
This is a project that i worked on in my free time to print out the price of bitcoin in realtime. This functions with the use of the websockets library and coinbase's WSS server. Please make credit me if you use this code for anything other than personal use.

## Install
To run this code, make sure that you have node, https://nodejs.org/en/, and run `npm install websockets`. This is all it takes for setup.

## Usage
